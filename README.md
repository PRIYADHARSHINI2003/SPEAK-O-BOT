2) The user can add their own sign language gestures such as hello, sorry , victory and so much more and train our model. The user can add the gestures name and show the gesture on camera and add 30 samples for training.


3) Once all the gestures are added by the user and trained , the user can click on the translate button for our model to work.

4) The transaltion can be started with the start sign gesture and our model will recognise the sign gesture shown by the user and translates it to text and voice also.The translation can be stopped by stop sign gesture.
